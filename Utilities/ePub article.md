## *Save an article from the internet as an ePub*

---
### My Workflow
1. **Read headlines** from various news sources. 
    If there's an article I'd like to dig deeper into, I simply tap the Share button and Shortcut name (ePub article). 
    The articles are automatically uploaded to a folder in iCloud. 
2. **Transfer articles to Kindle** 
    The folder is monitored by the application [Calibre (ebook management)](https://calibre-ebook.com/), which does all the work by converting the file to AZW3 (Kindle) and places the artcles on my Kindle. 
3. **Start reading**
    All the highlights from my Kindle are automatically transferred to [Obsidian (note-taking)](https://obsidian.md/), which I have access to from anywhere. 
    Additionally, the word lookups that I do are automatically transferred to [Anki (flashcards)](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
