"When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. 
In learning to write, the pupil goes over with his pen what the teacher has outlined in pencil: so in reading; the greater part of the work of thought is already done for us. This is why it relieves us to take up a book after being occupied with our own thoughts. And in reading, the mind is, in fact, only the playground of another’s thoughts. 
So it comes about that if anyone spends almost the whole day in reading, and by way of relaxation devotes the intervals to some thoughtless pastime, he gradually loses the capacity for thinking; just as the man who always rides, at last forgets how to walk. 
*This is the case with many learned persons: they have read themselves stupid*"
==Arthur Schopenhauer==

*the will is identified with ultimate reality and happiness is only achieved by abnegating the will (as desire)*
==Arthur Schopenhauer==

Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.
==Winston Churchill==
  
È solo un trucco
"Finisce sempre così.
Con la morte.
Prima, però, c'è stata la vita,
nascosta sotto il bla bla bla bla bla.
È tutto sedimentato sotto il chiacchiericcio e il rumore.
Il silenzio e il sentimento.
L'emozione e la paura.
Gli sparuti incostanti sprazzi di bellezza.
E poi lo squallore disgraziato e l'uomo miserabile.
Tutto sepolto dalla coperta dell'imbarazzo dello stare al mondo. Bla. Bla. Bla. Bla.
Altrove, c'è l'altrove. Io non mi occupo dell'altrove. Dunque, che questo romanzo abbia inizio. 
In fondo, è solo un trucco. Sì, è solo un trucco."

“This is how it always ends.
With death.
But first there was life.
Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
It is all settled beneath the chitter chatter and the noise.
Silence and sentiment.
Emotion and fear.
The haggard, inconstant flashes of beauty.
And then the wretched squalor and miserable humanity.
All buried under the cover of the embarrassment of being in the world… blah, blah, blah, blah.”
==Jeb Gambardella (fictional), La Grande Belezza== 

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
“Daring Greatly”
==Theodore Roosevelt ==

"Cuando no puedo mirar tu cara 
miro tus pies. 
Tus pies de hueso arqueado, 
tus pequeños pies duros. 
Yo se que te sostienen, 
y que tu dulce peso 
sobre ellos se levanta. 
Tu cintura y tus pechos, 
la duplicada púrpura 
de tus pezones, 
la caja de tus ojos 
que recién han volado, 
tu ancha boca de fruta, 
tu cabellera roja, 
pequeña torre mía. 
Pero no amo tus pies 
sino porque anduvieron 
sobre la tierra y sobre 
el viento y sobre el agua, 
hasta que me encontraron".
Tus Pies (consider using green ink, because: "his personal symbol for desire and hope.”
==Pablo Neruda==

“We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.”
==Pico Iyer==

“Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.”

“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
