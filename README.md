# Shortcuts
### *A repository of various examples of Shortcuts (ï£¿ platforms)*

From Wikipedia:
> Shortcuts (formerly Workflow) is a visual scripting application developed by Apple and provided on its iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS operating systems. It allows users to create macros for executing specific tasks on their device(s).
> Shortcuts are activated manually through the app, shortcut widgets, the share sheet, and Siri. They can also be automated to trigger after an event, such as the time of day, leaving a set location, or opening an app.

I've found Shortcuts to be the easiest visual programming language to draft various application ideas. Instead of writing, drawing, mapping the ideas down, it is far easier to create a visual and fully functional application within minutes - and as a bonus, I've found other (non-programmers/[*Mugglers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle)) to be much more receptive towards my ideas because they can *see* them.
